# Happy Graduation, Sayang

A small Flutter 3.24 app that celebrates graduation moments with a swipeable gallery, heartfelt congrats, and a TikTok AR filter redirect.

## Features
- Splash with navigation to gallery, congrats, and AR filter redirect.
- Gallery carousel backed by static JSON memories.
- Congrats page with confetti overlay.
- AR redirect powered by `url_launcher`.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Flutter 3.24+ installed.
2. Fetch packages:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

Assets are already wired through `pubspec.yaml`. Drop your own JPEGs into `assets/images/` (matching the names referenced in
`assets/data/memories.json`) to personalize the memories.
